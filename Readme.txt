ref_img folder contains 106 reference images.
jnd_img folder contains 1,642 distortion images with a total of 25 distortion types as follows:

01 Additive Gaussian noise 
02 Additive noise in color components 
03 Masked noise 
04 High frequency noise 
05 Denoise 
06 Multiplicative noise 
07 Comfort noise 
08 Motion blur 
09 Gaussian blur 
10 Color diffusion 
11 Color shift 
12 Color quantization 
13 Color saturation 
14 JPEG 
15 JPEG transmission errors 
16 JPEG2000 
17 Darken 
18 Brighten 
19 Mean shift 
20 Jitter 
21 Non-eccentricity patch 
22 Quantization 
23 Contrast change 
24 Sparse sampling and reconstruction 
25 Chromatic aberrations 

Label naming convention: Taking I01_02_01 as an example, I01 represents the reference image serial number, 02 represents the distortion type serial number, and 01 indicates the distortion level.
